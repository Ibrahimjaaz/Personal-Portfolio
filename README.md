# Personal-Portfolio
I took on the challenge of designing and building my personal portfolio website using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. With CSS, I carefully crafted the visual appearance of my website, ensuring a clean and professional layout that highlights my work. HTML provided the structural framework, allowing me to organize my content in a logical and accessible manner. To add interactivity and enhance the user experience, I utilized JavaScript to create dynamic elements, such as smooth scrolling, image galleries, and form validation. By leveraging these technologies, I was able to create a visually impressive and functional portfolio website that effectively showcases my skills, achievements, and projects. The process of developing my website from scratch allowed me to truly personalize every aspect and demonstrate my proficiency in web development.
